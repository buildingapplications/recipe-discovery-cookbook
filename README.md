## How can I edit this app?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Bilt**

Simply visit your [Bilt Project](https://bilt.me/projects/cbee8a72-0fb1-49e7-85f5-3596d5cdec94) and start sending messages. Describe what you want to change, add, or fix in natural language.

Changes made via Bilt are instant - just send a message and your app updates.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can export the source code from Bilt and make changes directly.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Export and clone your Bilt project.
# (Download source from Bilt or connect to your git repo)
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm install

# Step 4: Start the Expo development server.
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go on your phone to see your app running locally.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.

Connect any MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, etc.) to programmatically build and modify mobile apps.

**Example MCP integration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bilt": {
      "transport": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "https://mcp.bilt.me/mcp/sse",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
        }
